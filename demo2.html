                                        If you’ve had to cancel or change your non-refundable flight, most airlines will offer you a credit instead of a refund. Here’s the things you should know.<br>
    <br><b>Using your flight credit issued due to COVID-19</b>
    
    <br>
    First, you will need to have the itinerary number, credit amount, and traveler name(s) handy to get started. Your flight credit can be used immediately. Currently, the only option to redeem a flight credit for future use, is by calling us. Given the high demand, we are prioritizing work on online solutions. We look forward to providing you an update here soon.  <br>
    <br>
    <b>COVID-19 flight credit rules:</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>The airlines are setting the policies for how you can redeem your airline credit.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Each airline credit is in the original traveler’s name.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Airline credits cannot be combined or transferred to another person.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Airline credits must be used for air travel, including taxes and fees, with the airline that originally issued the ticket.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Airline credits cannot be used for ancillary services.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Airline credit comes with a travel-by date (sometimes called credit validity), so be sure to factor that into your planning. As soon as we confirm your credit validity date with our partner, we will communicate it to you via email.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>For travel originally scheduled between March 19th and April 30th, we confirmed with our airline partner, that any applicable change fees would be waived.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <b>Not affected by COVID-19? Here's the scoop on using your flight credit</b>
    <br>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>Airline credit comes with a travel-by date, so be sure to factor that into your planning. (See your cancellation email for your specific ticket policies and details.)</li>
    <br>
    <li>Airlines give separate credits to each traveler; you won’t be able to combine or transfer credits.</li>
    <br>
    <li>This credit can be used only by the person whose name is on the ticket, and only with the airline that provided the credit.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <b>Cars</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered by taking into account price and other factors such as the number of bookings of an offer to date, customer review scores, car category/type and pick-up location relative to your arrival location.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <b>Cruises</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered by taking into account factors such as cruise line rating, ship rating, price per day, origin rating, destination rating, length of cruise and booking window.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <b>Things to Do</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered by taking into account factors such as price, searched-for experiences, location including distance from accommodation options, traveller reviews and local research. In addition, they may also take into account number of bookings to date and compensation we may earn on a booking.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <b>Combined Searches and Vacation Packages</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered by the criteria outlined above for each individual component.</li>
        </ul>
    
    If you select a specific <b>sort order option</b> such as those prioritising price, deals, guest reviews, property class or rating, distance from centre, etc., the results list will be ordered with a focus on your selected priorities, using the factors described above as they relate to your search. This will also be the case for some pages that showcase offers in a destination or for a style of accommodation, etc.
    <br>
    If you apply a <b>filter</b>, the results list will be presented using the factors described above as they relate to your search, filtered by the specific feature(s) and amenity(ies) you’ve selected.
    <br>
    We’re constantly updating our systems and testing new ways to refine your results to make them as relevant as possible to accommodate your needs.

                                            There are many travel options available on our sites and we want to make your search results as relevant as possible. That’s why we offer lots of ways to help you search for and plan your travel.<br>
        <br>
        Our site uses complex, dynamic algorithms to ensure your search results are ordered efficiently.<br>
        <br>
        On the search results page, you can select how to sort the results we display, and also use filter options to see only those search results that meet your chosen preferences. If you don’t decide to use these features, then you’ll see our chosen default sort order which orders results as follows:<br>
        <br>
        <b>Flights</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered lowest to highest price. Where two flights have the same price, the shorter flight is listed first.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>Accommodation</b>
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered starting with the most relevant and competitive offers based on a range of factors, including a property’s offered price compared to its historical prices, its guest rating, number of reviews, number of bookings to date, and location (relative to your destination search).</li>
        <br>
        <li>They are also further differentiated by traveller satisfaction factors, including the range and quality of images and information provided for properties, the number of guest relocations and the number of refunds due to complaints about stays, property availability on our sites, and the overall price competitiveness for our travellers.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In addition, how much we are paid (eg: commissions from accommodation or compensation on bookings) when you book a property and such booking is completed is one of the factors taken into consideration when determining the relative order of properties with similar offers in our search results listings. What we are paid recognises the part we play in listing the property on our site, facilitating the booking and facilitating your stay at the property. Where we are displaying properties with a similar offer, then a booking from which we are paid more commission or compensation will feature higher in our search results listing compared to other properties with similar offers where we are paid less commission or compensation on the booking.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <b>Flights</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered lowest to highest price. Where two flights have the same price, the shorter flight is listed first.</li>

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered starting with the most relevant and competitive offers based on a range of factors, including a property’s offered price compared to its historical prices, its guest rating, number of reviews, number of bookings to date, and location (relative to your destination search).</li>
        <br>
        <li>They are also further differentiated by traveller satisfaction factors, including the range and quality of images and information provided for properties, the number of guest relocations and the number of refunds due to complaints about stays, property availability on our sites, and the overall price competitiveness for our travellers.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In addition, how much we are paid (eg: commissions from accommodation or compensation on bookings) when you book a property and such booking is completed is one of the factors taken into consideration when determining the relative order of properties with similar offers in our search results listings. What we are paid recognises the part we play in listing the property on our site, facilitating the booking and facilitating your stay at the property. Where we are displaying properties with a similar offer, then a booking from which we are paid more commission or compensation will feature higher in our search results listing compared to other properties with similar offers where we are paid less commission or compensation on the booking.</li>

        <b>Cruises</b>

        <b>Things to Do</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered by taking into account factors such as price, searched-for experiences, location including distance from accommodation options, traveller reviews and local research. In addition, they may also take into account number of bookings to date and compensation we may earn on a booking.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <b>Combined Searches and Vacation Packages</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered by the criteria outlined above for each individual component.</li>
            </ul>
        
        If you select a specific <b>sort order option</b> such as those prioritising price, deals, guest reviews, property class or rating, distance from centre, etc., the results list will be ordered with a focus on your selected priorities, using the factors described above as they relate to your search. This will also be the case for some pages that showcase offers in a destination or for a style of accommodation, etc.
        <br>
        If you apply a <b>filter</b>, the results list will be presented using the factors described above as they relate to your search, filtered by the specific feature(s) and amenity(ies) you’ve selected.
