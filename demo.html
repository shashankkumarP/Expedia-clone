                                        There are many travel options available on our sites and we want to make your search results as relevant as possible. That’s why we offer lots of ways to help you search for and plan your travel.<br>
    <br>
    Our site uses complex, dynamic algorithms to ensure your search results are ordered efficiently.<br>
    <br>
    On the search results page, you can select how to sort the results we display, and also use filter options to see only those search results that meet your chosen preferences. If you don’t decide to use these features, then you’ll see our chosen default sort order which orders results as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Flights</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered lowest to highest price. Where two flights have the same price, the shorter flight is listed first.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <b>Accommodation</b>
    <br>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
    <li>Results are ordered starting with the most relevant and competitive offers based on a range of factors, including a property’s offered price compared to its historical prices, its guest rating, number of reviews, number of bookings to date, and location (relative to your destination search).</li>
    <br>
    <li>They are also further differentiated by traveller satisfaction factors, including the range and quality of images and information provided for properties, the number of guest relocations and the number of refunds due to complaints about stays, property availability on our sites, and the overall price competitiveness for our travellers.</li>
    <br>
    <li>In addition, how much we are paid (eg: commissions from accommodation or compensation on bookings) when you book a property and such booking is completed is one of the factors taken into consideration when determining the relative order of properties with similar offers in our search results listings. What we are paid recognises the part we play in listing the property on our site, facilitating the booking and facilitating your stay at the property. Where we are displaying properties with a similar offer, then a booking from which we are paid more commission or compensation will feature higher in our search results listing compared to other properties with similar offers where we are paid less commission or compensation on the booking.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <b>Cars</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered by taking into account price and other factors such as the number of bookings of an offer to date, customer review scores, car category/type and pick-up location relative to your arrival location.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <b>Cruises</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered by taking into account factors such as cruise line rating, ship rating, price per day, origin rating, destination rating, length of cruise and booking window.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <b>Things to Do</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered by taking into account factors such as price, searched-for experiences, location including distance from accommodation options, traveller reviews and local research. In addition, they may also take into account number of bookings to date and compensation we may earn on a booking.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <b>Combined Searches and Vacation Packages</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered by the criteria outlined above for each individual component.</li>
        </ul>
    
    If you select a specific <b>sort order option</b> such as those prioritising price, deals, guest reviews, property class or rating, distance from centre, etc., the results list will be ordered with a focus on your selected priorities, using the factors described above as they relate to your search. This will also be the case for some pages that showcase offers in a destination or for a style of accommodation, etc.
    <br>
    If you apply a <b>filter</b>, the results list will be presented using the factors described above as they relate to your search, filtered by the specific feature(s) and amenity(ies) you’ve selected.
    <br>
    We’re constantly updating our systems and testing new ways to refine your results to make them as relevant as possible to accommodate your needs.

If you don’t decide to use these features, then you’ll see our chosen default sort order which orders results as follows:<br>
        <br>
        <b>Flights</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered lowest to highest price. Where two flights have the same price, the shorter flight is listed first.</li>

        <b>Accommodation</b>
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered starting with the most relevant and competitive offers based on a range of factors, including a property’s offered price compared to its historical prices, its guest rating, number of reviews, number of bookings to date, and location (relative to your destination search).</li>
        <br>
        <li>They are also further differentiated by traveller satisfaction factors, including the range and quality of images and information provided for properties, the number of guest relocations and the number of refunds due to complaints about stays, property availability on our sites, and the overall price competitiveness for our travellers.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In addition, how much we are paid (eg: commissions from accommodation or compensation on bookings) when you book a property and such booking is completed is one of the factors taken into consideration when determining the relative order of properties with similar offers in our search results listings. What we are paid recognises the part we play in listing the property on our site, facilitating the booking and facilitating your stay at the property. Where we are displaying properties with a similar offer, then a booking from which we are paid more commission or compensation will feature higher in our search results listing compared to other properties with similar offers where we are paid less commission or compensation on the booking.</li>

        <b>Cars</b>

        <b>Cruises</b>

        <b>Things to Do</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered by taking into account factors such as price, searched-for experiences, location including distance from accommodation options, traveller reviews and local research. In addition, they may also take into account number of bookings to date and compensation we may earn on a booking.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <b>Combined Searches and Vacation Packages</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered by the criteria outlined above for each individual component.</li>
            </ul>
        
        If you select a specific <b>sort order option</b> such as those prioritising price, deals, guest reviews, property class or rating, distance from centre, etc., the results list will be ordered with a focus on your selected priorities, using the factors described above as they relate to your search. This will also be the case for some pages that showcase offers in a destination or for a style of accommodation, etc.
        <br>
        If you apply a <b>filter</b>, the results list will be presented using the factors described above as they relate to your search, filtered by the specific feature(s) and amenity(ies) you’ve selected.

                                            There are many travel options available on our sites and we want to make your search results as relevant as possible. That’s why we offer lots of ways to help you search for and plan your travel.<br>
        <br>
        Our site uses complex, dynamic algorithms to ensure your search results are ordered efficiently.<br>
        <br>
        On the search results page, you can select how to sort the results we display, and also use filter options to see only those search results that meet your chosen preferences. If you don’t decide to use these features, then you’ll see our chosen default sort order which orders results as follows:<br>
        <br>
        <b>Flights</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered lowest to highest price. Where two flights have the same price, the shorter flight is listed first.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>Accommodation</b>
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Results are ordered starting with the most relevant and competitive offers based on a range of factors, including a property’s offered price compared to its historical prices, its guest rating, number of reviews, number of bookings to date, and location (relative to your destination search).</li>
        <br>
        <li>They are also further differentiated by traveller satisfaction factors, including the range and quality of images and information provided for properties, the number of guest relocations and the number of refunds due to complaints about stays, property availability on our sites, and the overall price competitiveness for our travellers.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In addition, how much we are paid (eg: commissions from accommodation or compensation on bookings) when you book a property and such booking is completed is one of the factors taken into consideration when determining the relative order of properties with similar offers in our search results listings. What we are paid recognises the part we play in listing the property on our site, facilitating the booking and facilitating your stay at the property. Where we are displaying properties with a similar offer, then a booking from which we are paid more commission or compensation will feature higher in our search results listing compared to other properties with similar offers where we are paid less commission or compensation on the booking.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>Cars</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered by taking into account price and other factors such as the number of bookings of an offer to date, customer review scores, car category/type and pick-up location relative to your arrival location.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <b>Cruises</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered by taking into account factors such as cruise line rating, ship rating, price per day, origin rating, destination rating, length of cruise and booking window.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <b>Things to Do</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered by taking into account factors such as price, searched-for experiences, location including distance from accommodation options, traveller reviews and local research. In addition, they may also take into account number of bookings to date and compensation we may earn on a booking.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <b>Combined Searches and Vacation Packages</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
            <li>Results are ordered by the criteria outlined above for each individual component.</li>
            </ul>
        
        If you select a specific <b>sort order option</b> such as those prioritising price, deals, guest reviews, property class or rating, distance from centre, etc., the results list will be ordered with a focus on your selected priorities, using the factors described above as they relate to your search. This will also be the case for some pages that showcase offers in a destination or for a style of accommodation, etc.
        <br>
        If you apply a <b>filter</b>, the results list will be presented using the factors described above as they relate to your search, filtered by the specific feature(s) and amenity(ies) you’ve selected.
        <br>
        We’re constantly updating our systems and testing new ways to refine your results to make them as relevant as possible to accommodate your needs.
